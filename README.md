<h1>Simple steps to creating a Virtual Machine in Azure.</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe one of the various ways you can setup a virtual machine in Azure.  I tried to keep
this tutorial as simple as possible.  Just believe in yourself, and you can do this. Good Luck!!<br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machine Quick Setup Guide](https://youtu.be/9FCHsSQ4GK8?si=Yf0xkNH9phhT7FVd)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop


<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)





<h2> Follow Steps Below <h2>

<h2> Step </h2>
    In this first step above, it's important to create the virutal machine.  You do this by simply searching for the virtual machine resource in the search box at the top of screen.  Next, by clicking on the create button this will now begin the creation portion of the virtual machine.  Within the next screen you will need to set/create your own resource group.  In this case the resource group is named Virtual Machine-01.  The next section is to choose the correct region where your virtual machine will be located.  Now move on to the next step.

</p>
<p>
<h2> Step </h2>
    Now, it's time to select your Image file.  The image file is basically what type of virtual machine Operating System will be used.  Here, you can see in the picture, we have choosen the Windows 10 OS.  Aslo, it's important to pick the correct cpu size/quantity.  In, most cases 2vcpus will be enough.  Now, Go to the next step please.

<p>
<h2> Step </h2>  
    Next, create and pick a proper administrative username and password.  Keep in mind these credentials will be used to sign into the virtual machine virtually, at some later time.  Select review and create to submit the creation.  Please go to the next step.

</p>
<p>
<h2> Step </h2>  
    Now as for my favorite section of this tutorial, Go to the networking tab and see how the virtual machine now has networking properties already pre-filled out for you.  Leave these settings as default and now click on create at the bottom right of the screen.  Now you can see as the virtual machine loads it begins to create your VM resources.  Now that's it!!!!  Your all done.  Just click on search, and look for virtual machines to navigate back to the machine and your all done.
